There are so many factors affecting a player’s performance. It’s sometimes hard for us (as FPL managers) to choose which players we should transfer in or transfer out based on their performance stats. Here, the k-means cluster can determine the player’s cluster. So, we are able to know which players have good stats or bad stats. Data used was retrieved from FPL API.

[Publication](https://jurnal.usk.ac.id/natural/article/view/36076/20254)

Data came from World Value Survey (WVS) Wave 7 with 11,387 individuals from the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Data used were analyzed using an ordinal response multilevel model with the level of happiness as a response variable. The results showed that the happiness level was affected by gender, marital status, health status, income, religiosity, education level, life satisfaction, and freedom of choice. However, age at the individual level and variables at the country level did not affect the happiness level.
